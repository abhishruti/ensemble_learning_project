Problem statement:

Project: Building Basic predictive models over the NYC Taxi Trip dataset.
You are provided with the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset. This dataset contains information about the
taxi trips that took place in different parts of New York City and how much time did that trip take
to complete.
In this project, the following are the tasks you have to complete and submit in a .zip file.:
1. Build a K-Nearest neighbours model for the given dataset and find the best value of K.
2. Build a Linear model for the given dataset with regularisation.
3. Build a Random Forest model for the given dataset.
4. Build a Gradient Boosting model for the given dataset.
5. Combine all the models above using the averaging technique to generate the final
predictions.
